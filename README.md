# U2FToken
An U2F Token implementation based on JavaCard... Not implemented now...

// TODO  
1. For now, the key handle will be implemented as the index of the user's private key, since even if the newly JavaCard 3.0.5 doesn't implement the key wrapping algorithm.
Laterly, I will try to implement a key wrapping algorithm based on AES according to <https://github.com/paulej/AESKeyWrap>
